# Title :-Staff-Sync - Employee Management System

# ABSTRACT
          1) The Employee Management System  is designed as more than a full-stack web application to automate and streamline Human Resource (HR) operations within an organization. 
             The system's platform handles employee records, monitors attendance, processes leave requests, and generates automated payroll.
             
          2) The backend is developed through using Java Spring Boot along with MySQL as the database for secure data handling. 
             This also ensures data handling that is efficient. React is what the frontend utilizes,and it can provide a user-friendly interactive interface. 
             JWT-based authentication coupled with role-based access control (Admin, HR, Employee) enforce security by design.
